# Gundam-Official-Artificial-Gravity-Patent.
Hull charging creates gravity by magnetic electron force. Electron charge of "Ceiling areas" and electron negative ground charge of "floor areas" is a verified method to produce gravity in space vehicles. Control of the ground / ceiling charge is key to controlling gravity forces.
